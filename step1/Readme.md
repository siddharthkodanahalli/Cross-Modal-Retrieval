Canonical Correlation Analysis is a method of correlating linear relationships between two variables, thus it can also be seen as using complex labels to guide feature selection and link the common representations (i.e. image and text representations in this case).

CCA Zoo library was used in this step to build different CCA models for image and different text embeddings (title, ingredients and instructions). The model evaluation has been done using metrics like median rank and recall rates at top 1, 5, and 10.
